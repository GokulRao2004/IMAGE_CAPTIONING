# Llama3.2-11B-Vision Example: Image and Text Processing with Transformers

This project demonstrates the use of a **Llama3.2-11B-Vision** model for processing images and generating text. The example provided showcases the generation of a response based on an image input and a user-provided textual prompt using a locally stored model.

---

## Features

- **Image Input**: Accepts image data from a URL or file.
- **Text Generation**: Combines image features and user prompts to generate text.
- **Local Model Loading**: Uses a model stored locally for offline processing.
- **Transformer Integration**: Leverages Hugging Face's `transformers` library for model loading, tokenization, and generation.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python libraries:
  - `torch`
  - `transformers`
  - `Pillow`
  - `requests`

## How It Works

1. **Load the Model and Processor**:
   - The **Llama3.2-11B-Vision** model and its associated processor are loaded from a local directory using Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
   - The processor handles input preparation, ensuring compatibility with the model.

2. **Prepare the Input**:
   - An image is fetched from a URL or loaded from a local file.
   - A structured message is defined, including both the image and a textual prompt provided by the user.

3. **Process Input**:
   - The processor applies a chat template to format the input text and image data.
   - This combined input is tokenized and converted into tensors.
   - The processed inputs are moved to the same device (e.g., GPU or CPU) as the model for efficient computation.

4. **Generate Output**:
   - The model generates text based on the combined image features and textual prompt.
   - The output is constrained by a specified `max_new_tokens` parameter to limit the length of the generated response.

5. **Decode and Display Output**:
   - The processor decodes the model's output into human-readable text.
   - The final generated response is printed or displayed for the user.

6. **Example Workflow**:
   - Input: An image of a rabbit and the text prompt *"If I had to write a haiku for this one, it would be:"*.
   - Processing: The model combines the visual features of the image with the text prompt to generate a relevant response.
   - Output: A creative haiku describing the image, such as:
     ```
     A rabbit hopping,  
     Fields of green and sky above,  
     Gentle spring whispers.  
     ```
